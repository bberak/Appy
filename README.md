====================

Repository for holding Appy - quick desktop apps for web developers! Like PhoneGap for the desktop.

# Read This!

* I have not provided a license for this work. If you would like to use this work in any way - contact me.
* I will put up a more detailed guide with code-walkthroughs shortly.

# How To Start

* Build solution in VS 2012 or stay tuned for the binaries (uploading soon). Ensure that your platform config is set to x86 when buidling!
* Run the 'Appy' project or Appy.exe (if you downloaded the binaries).
* To bootstrap a new project press b + enter and follow the prompts.
* To compile an existing project press c + enter and follow the prompts.

# Developing Your App

* Make changes to the contents of the Site folder - this is basically an HTML5 website and will make up your UI.
* Make changes to the Code folder - this is the logic of your app. Feel free to add more of your own 'controller' classes (note: they don't have to inherit from Controller). In fact, add any class that you need - just make sure it is valid C# code.
* PS. when creating new 'controller' classes - you must import the Appy.Core namespace ('using Appy.Core;').

# Apologies

* I know this is such a poor guide.. I promise to publish something comprehensive very soon. However, if you need help now, send me an email and I will get back to you ASAP.
